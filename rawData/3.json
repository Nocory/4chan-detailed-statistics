          "com": "<span style=\"font-weight:bold;color:#2074ce;\">FAQ</span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>1.) &quot;How do I get started in 3D?&quot;</i>\n<br>\nThere are many ways to get started, the quickest way is to actually start with a 3D program. There are many to choose from, such as:\n<br>\n-3DS Max<br>\n-Cinema 4D<br>\n-Maya<br>\n-Softimage XSI<br>\n-Lightwave<br>\n-Blender 3D (Free!)<br>\n<br>\nOnce you obtain one the next step is to start with tutorials. There are many on the net, they range from text and image tutorials to video tutorials. You aren&#039;t going to find a tutorial for everything out there, but most will explain techniques that you need to adapt in order for you to achieve whatever final result you want.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>2.) &quot;Wow! That&#039;s a lot of programs! Which one is best? I heard ______ is best.&quot;</i>\n<br>\nYou heard wrong, there is no one program that is better than the rest, it has and always will be the skill level of the artist. Which program you choose is solely dependent on your own personal taste and which aspect of the 3D industry you want to be involved in.<br>\nMax and Maya are the most hyped and so therefore the most used, they have the most available documentation online. The interfaces have a steep learning curve, but there isn&#039;t any 3D program you can&#039;t learn if you take the time to use it and follow some tutorials. Go with a generalized package, not a specialist one.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>3.) &quot;Whoah, Generalized vs Specialized? How do I know?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nA generalised package like Maya, Max, Softimage are packages that let you model, render, animate, texture, and create dynamics all within the same application. They don&#039;t require third party plugins or applications to add another basic feature, like a renderer or animation tools.<br>\nHowever you can get plugins for these apps to enhance their features. There are several Specialized applications out there that cater to a specific skill.<br>\n<br>\nAnimation: Motion Builder, Messiah 3D.<br>\nModeling: Modo, Wings3D, Silo 3D<br>\nCAD: Autocad, Sketchup, SolidWorks<br>\nDetailing: Zbrush, Mudbox, 3DCoat<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>4.) &quot;Ooooo Zbrush, I see so much awesome shit from that, I&#039;m gonna start there!&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, you&#039;re getting ahead of yourself. You should start learning about basic modeling and topology before jumping into Zbrush. Zbrush is a great program for advanced users to add detail to their existing models, or to prototype models quickly by sculpting them out.<br>\nIt is not a good idea to get into Zbrush when you&#039;re not very familiar with general 3D concepts<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>5) &quot;Ok, I see I&#039;m not very good at this stuff, can you model ______ for me?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, anybody with any decent skill on this board does this work for a living or for some kind of gain. Some of those just starting out may pick up the project but don&#039;t expect Miets Meier level of work. You get what you pay for.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>6.) &quot;But it&#039;s too haaaaaaaaard, isn&#039;t there any easy button?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nNo, like all things it takes time and effort to master a program, practice makes perfect and playing around with the interface will get the shortcuts ingrained into your muscle memory.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>7.) &quot;So which program is the easiest to learn?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nYou shouldn&#039;t learn a program, you should learn techniques. When you master a technique the program becomes nothing more than a tool. As said before Max and Maya have the most documentation but you should look at learning how to model and the right techniques instead of &#039;what button does X&#039;.<br>\nYou can get UI information from the program&#039;s help files. F1 and Google are your friends.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>8.) &quot;So, what do studios look for when hiring if I don&#039;t know program ______ won&#039;t I get turned down?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nWhen a studio judges your demo reel and resume they have an order of priority.<br>\n<br>\n1-Quality of Work<br>\n2-Versatility<br>\n3-Experience<br>\n4-Program skills<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>9.) &quot;So studios don&#039;t care what program I use? Why do they care about versatility?&quot;<br></i>\n<br>\nExcept for Animators who are pretty much exempt from most rules of 3D, most studios want people who can perform multiple tasks instead of just a specialised one. They want modelers who can also texture, they want riggers who can also do dynamics, they want lighters who can also texture. It&#039;s ok to be specialised in one area, but it doesn&#039;t hurt to be versatile, it will always keep you employed.<br>\n<br>\nWhen a studio looks at your program skills they do often look to see if you have experience in their preferred in house package, but MANY times you&#039;re going to get a studio that has added their own tools and pipeline so it wouldn&#039;t matter what program you know as long as your skills are good. If you know techniques you can pretty much pickup any 3D package in a matter of days. Of course there are some that are hard set that you know program ________ but for the most part what package you know is not that important (yes even you Blender fags can get a job in a studio if you know good techniques.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>10.) &quot;What about gaming?&quot;<br></i>\nWhat about it?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>11.) &quot;How do I make my own game? How do I program shaders or a video game?&quot;<br></i>\nThis is a 3D board, not a programming board! Do you want to make 3D game assets or do you want to be a programmer?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>12.) &quot;Uhhhh....&quot;<br></i>\nExactly.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>13.) If you want to get into game asset creating, your three primary focus of interests are:<br></i>\n-Modeling<br>\n-Texturing<br>\n-Animation<br>\n<br>\nLow poly modeling is an art in itself, trying to get as much detail with as few polys as possible takes some practice, there is no formula for this. You create a low poly model and use techniques such as good UV textures and normal maps to enhance the look of the model in the game engine.<br>\n<br>\nTwo great places to start for game asset creation:<br>\nhttp://www.poopinmymouth.com/tutori<wbr>al/tutorial.htm <br>\nhttp://www.gameartisans.org/gamecon<wbr>/tutorials/tut_3.htm <br>\n<br>\nAnimating for games is pretty much the same as for movies, except that your model has a higher chance of deforming badly and you may not have as much control over your rig. Still the basic concepts of animation will always apply.<br>",

The CG scenes, however, were printed out straight to video - they never made it onto celluloid- and so they would look like utter shit next to the hi resolution film scans. So they had to be completely recreated - they tried not to &#039;improve&#039; any of the CG from back then, and instead just tried to copy the sequences exactly - but they are inevitably a bit better looking all round.<br><br>Incidentally- there are one or two very occasional live-action shots on the bridge of the Enterprise that were for some reason shot on video. These sequences obviously couldn&#039;t be recreated so they just went into the remaster as-is and they look like absolute fucking dogshit when intercut between the 35mm scans. If you watch all of TNG on Netflix, you&#039;ll see these shots - you literally can&#039;t miss them.",

Progressive renders will save their final state if you cancel them midway.)<br>Alternatively, numpad-0 to switch to your camera view, shift-z to enter render preview, it&#039;ll preview your scene with your depth of field settings too.<br>If you&#039;re spending 12+ hours on a render, either you&#039;re running a shit tier computer or you don&#039;t have Blender optimised.

You got 2 circles for legs, and between them goes another circle to the from for vulva, and another underneath it for the anus.

It&#039;s also great because I have as reference the data I&#039;ve baked from the scan (though it looks a bit weird because it&#039;s mirrored)",

Consider this small project - model the ass further, I really love the small textured bumps on the texture before the uv edges end. Texture the whole ass and then model intricate anus and finish the vaginal cavity + womb as well and texure them as well as you can. Then create a nice skin shader (this looks already good even though it&#039;s opengl view...) but with SSS and proper highlights. <br>Then load everything into your favorite animation package (I prefer Houdini and Maya - I would suggest Maya or even Max if you don&#039;t know Maya or Houdini) and then rig both anus and vagina so the lips open proper way and the muscles contract. <br>Then do insertion anim where the ass is pounded with a glass dildo - both into ass and vagina. Then animate the penetration and how it moves the flesh out of the way and how all the muscles contract.<br>Then you can do a like medical view as well where you slice the model in half and it shows the penetration in detail from the side view. Bit like in some Japanese hentai animes.<br>It&#039;s going to be cool but it will take a long time.

Cool eh.. You could also add a real hair sim setup for the pubic hairs. Then if you use Houdini (of course you can do it other software as well but Houdini is easy in this way..) you could make wetmaps from the dildo - when it brushes against the hair it will paint a wetmap on them and apply &#039;wet&#039; status which makes the hair clump together and changes the shader more shiny - creating a simulation of wet sticky pubic hair. <br>Even this kind of small, inane animation project has so many little details which take long time to do.<br>I suggest learning Houdini for making this kind of simulations, it&#039;s the future of effects animation.",

Extreme colors like white or yellow should really only be used when trying to achieve a certain look.",

I&#039;d procrastinate and be paralyzed by weird fear and anxiety like you describe.<br><br>The way I unintentionally overcame this with 3D was by seeing a piece of art I appreciated and being like &quot;that doesn&#039;t seem so hard, I bet I can do that.&quot; I came up with my own conceptual twist on the art and decided I really wanted to make it, which gave me an actual tangible goal that meant something to me, as opposed to making a boring donut renders because that&#039;s what Mr. YouTube Tutorial Man told me to do. <br><br>One I had this goal in mind I just jumped into the app I was working with (C4D at the time) and started clicking around and figuring out how things work. When I&#039;d hit wall and not know how to proceed I&#039;d Google it and find relevant tutorials.<br><br>Everyone&#039;s different, but this really worked out for me. I was surprised to be making stuff I actually cared about within days, not months like I expected. A lot of the methods I was using were wrong, but I eventually learned the right way to do things out of sheer necessity of needing to execute more advanced techniques for more advanced projects.<br><br>tl;dr try to relax, come up with something fun to make, start experimenting, don&#039;t worry too much about what&#039;s right and wrong, and if everything goes right this process should motivate you to start learning and get the ball rolling. good luck, have fun.",

He just welds them afterwards and fixes issues and it&#039;s done.<br>Because not only this just looks cool as fuck, it&#039;s sort of how the actual robot would be built irl - it has a logic, if you look at panels were designed to fit each other, interlocking and holding the shape, you can trace how it was assembled. <br>This was really impressive and I wonder if there are other tricks like this, I would really like to adopt them.",

Never owned a camera until last year. I&#039;ve always wanted to do stop-motion and vfx. So last year I started playing around in Blender and got overwhelmed super quick. I went on cgpeers and downloaded over 100 gigs worth of tutorials. I still had major anxiety every single time I sat down and tried to learn 3D but then I started to realize that I was trying to cram every single piece of the software into my brain. Eat, sleep, and breathing it. It still wasn&#039;t clicking and I was getting more and more discouraged.<br><br>I changed how I was working, or trying, with the program. I stopped all the beginner shit. and jumped into what I actually cared about learning and tried to see how far I would have to backtrack to understand what I want. <br><br>So for example this week, I just got into animation nodes. I had no clue as what to look for but that was something I wanted to incorporate alongside my music. I just never knew what it was called.<br><br>I also grabbed the Flip Fluid addon that&#039;s floating around here and it encouraged me even more with vfx because now I can make horror-esque things to composite (blood, goo, shadows).<br><br>My goals are simple in the long run and it&#039;s all about finding the right tools for your needs. It&#039;s easy to be swayed of different opinion on this board with all of the baiting and shitposts but find an end goal with 3D. Don&#039;t be afraid to buy assets, rip them off, whatever...as long as you are understanding your wants and achieving your goal until you are satisfied or get good. It may take a while, you may have bursts of inspiration and then hit a wall. But that&#039;s natural. That is literally what makes this whole world and art fucking awesome. <br><br>I&#039;m just some anon and you are too but I believe in you. Shiposts and dumb shit aside, we are all working towards a goal and I hope you continue your 3D journey anon. Keep going!!!",

For reference, there are albums made in the 1990s on DAT whose master tapes are now unplayable because the way the DAT media they were recorded on degraded. Those albums are gone forever and any reissues of them will have to be made from second generation sources. If those masters had been transferred to standard 2&quot; analogue audio tape they would be ok.<br>Same goes for any digital moving image work - the only way the source can be reliably archived for generations is to transfer it to film; a 35mm negative has a molecular resolution depth equivalent to a 6k render so unless you&#039;re rendering at 8k there is a *lot* of resolution overhead available.<br>A case that proves my point was the Star Trek TNG Blu-Ray remaster: TNG was shot on 35mm film, and the negatives of all the live action were spliced together in editing the old fashioned way, with razors and splicing tape. The CGI sequences, however, were never transferred to film - they were printed to standard 1990s broadcast TV resolution video tape, (approx 0.5k). along with a transfer of the film edit and this was the tape that was then broadcast. So, when it came to remastering for 4K - the 35mm just needed to be scanned, the CGI sequences, however, needed to be completely remade from scratch. The original CGI project files and software were long, long gone.<br>Again - if the CGI had been preserved on a archival quality analogue format, it wouldn&#039;t have been an issue.<br><br>The other alternative is, I guess, - 8bit paper punch tape. (Pic related). You&#039;d need 4; one for the R, B, G and A channels. And I&#039;d guess several warehouses to store the reels for around 10 seconds of animation.",

The trouble was, it was proprietary; it used a non-standard encoding system so not just any company could make a DAT recorder - you had to pay Sony to license the technology.<br>The trouble was, that proprietary system was crazy unstable - the data was actually encoded across the surface of the tape at a slanted angle, as opposed to perfectly vertically aligned like every other tape format on Earth. This meant that over time, as the substrate that bonded the metal oxides to the tape shifted slightly the tapes became utterly, irretrievably corrupted. No DAT player could make sense of the garbled 1s and 0s it was reading. It was a clusterfuck.<br>Analogue tape, on the other hand, is open source, completely standard. The data on analogue tape is a collection of magnetic signals that will produce the same result on any player that can drive the tape past a playhead. Don&#039;t believe me? There was a guy in Russia who hand-built his own 2&quot; tape recorder machine, from scratch. This guy&#039;s hand built tape machine will play any analogue audio tape in the world, without issue.<br><br>Open source = archivability.<br>Proprietary = digital dark age.",

If you&#039;re UVing the model, that means you&#039;re finished modelling. If you&#039;re finished modelling, why haven&#039;t you collapsed the turbosmooth modifier into the mesh?<br><br>Creating an initial UV layout prior to final smoothing isn&#039;t a bad idea as it may be easier to work with fewer polys in the UV editor for breaking apart shells etc, but after applying and collapsing the smoothing modifier into the mesh you should still go in and relax the shells a little because they will have changed shape slightly.<br><br>General Max UV tips:<br>1. Get Marius Silaghi&#039;s &#039;Unwrap Pro&#039; modifier. It looks and functions exactly the same as the Max unwrap modifier, but with impproved unfold algorithm and shortcut keys. I couldn&#039;t live without it now.<br>2. Don&#039;t use the UVW map modifier for anything that&#039;s going to get a custom texture map. It&#039;s only for tillable textures really. It&#039;s a waste of time otherwise. I never use it.<br>3. Try my general all-purpose UV workflow with the Unwrap (or Unwrap Pro) modifier;<br>i) apply unwrap mod, select all faces of the mesh and hit &#039;quick planar map&#039; all the faces are now on one island, there&#039;s no seams and we&#039;ve got a clean layout to work with. Collapse this first mod into the mesh.<br>ii) now we start creating islands - go around either selecting faces, that you want to be isolated islands. When you&#039;ve got your island selected, hit quick planar map again - it&#039;s now an island. Now with Unwrap Pro you&#039;d just hit spacebar to unwrap the island and it&#039;d be perfectly flat, with regular Unwrap use either custom relax or &#039;relax till flat&#039; in the UV editor and it&#039;s done. Keep doing that around the mesh till everything&#039;s unwrapped.<br>iii) chose &#039;pack custom&#039; in the UV editor. Done.",

Rigid body sim is the way to do it realistically but Blender&#039;s solver is only designed to work forwards in time as far as I know. I&#039;m not at my PC but you could definitely try adjusting the frame rate mapping (same place as you set the render resolution) into a negative and/or setting the rigid body cache to run from 3 to 0 seconds, i.e. in reverse.<br>Assuming that the rigid body solver can&#039;t be made to run backwards, I would try to brute force the sim by writing a quick script to adjust initial velocities, surface response, random seed (if rigid body has one) and perhaps force fields. The script would opengl render the last frame of the sim with settings displayed in a text object so that I could just run it for a few hours and then choose the settings I like.<br>You could control the number the dice land on by just UVing after you&#039;re happy with the physics sim.<br>How&#039;s your Python?",

In this case you have to use a tool like Ninja Ripper that injects itself into the runtime of the game executable, and simply dumps all the model data wholesale, but this of course means that you need the model(s) visible on screen to dump it, and that you&#039;ll have a shit ton of trash data to sort through, since you&#039;ll literally be dumping everything that&#039;s a polygon on-screen. Another bad point to this is having to clean up all the models in your 3D editor of choice, you may have a big triangulated mess on your hands where you have to go through and weld up all the broken polys yourself and flip normals, but of course, results may once again vary. Either way, this is the most hands-on approach.",

I arrr&#039;d a model from one of those UE3 games, and it&#039;s all tris. <br>I&#039;ve started to &quot;retopo&quot; it by hand(mainly just following the locks, deleting extra edges adjusting them a bit, if that even qualifies as retopo) and now I&#039;m starting to wondering about what I&#039;m even going to do with this. It came fully weighed and with textures. I don&#039;t think I can use triangulated mesh for anything though. At least all tuts I&#039;ve watched and all folks I&#039;ve read here and there said that tris are only for finished product, and this one here was clearly finished product otherwise it wouldn&#039;t get into game. <br>But I want to tweak it so turning it to all quads seems like a logical choice.<br>Doing all of this by hand seems quite tedious though. Is this the only way? Or are there other more intelligent tools to get the thing back without breaking flow too much?

Chiefly you got Gotanda and GGX both of which are not present in ShadingModels.ush. Unless UE4 does some fuckery, adding Gotanda for example should just be about adding the following line to ShadingModels.ush right below Lambert, Burley, and ON:<br><br>float3 Diffuse = Diffuse_Gotanda( DiffuseColor, LobeRoughness[1], NoV, NoL, VoH );<br><br>And comment all the other diffuse BRDFs, of course. Again however I have no idea how Gotanda works, can&#039;t find much about it and what I do find does a lot more than just diffuse, so it&#039;s hard to tell what Gotanda diffuse will look like in UE4. Oh also you can hotload shaders so feel free to fuck with the files to your content with UE4 open, just hit CTRL+SHIFT+. (dot) to reload shaders.<br><br>That said, all this stuff is terribly documented. UE4 started with Lambert, then switched to Burley sometime around 4.8, now we&#039;re back to Lambert. Also, for some reason, textures seem to fuck up if you switch to something other than Lambert in some of Epic&#039;s example projects (in the racing game, which has the most rough textures and is a good testing ground for diffuse BRDF, the normals go apeshit and so does the texture tiling).",

But in the end, even that wasn&#039;t enough and also realtime just requires too many additional steps to work/look good, so unless you actually need realtime presentations, I&#039;d say offline rendering is still the way to go because it looks better with a lot less work.<br><br>As for TM, idk how 18 behaves but 17 had pretty long render times with large scenes. UE4 is a lot better in that regard - capturing a 3 minute cinematic in HD takes less than an hour, even if the PC is running the scene at 1fps (i7 4.2ghz, 1080ti). UEs lighting is shit tho. Doing lightmaps takes way too much time and every other engine now features some sort of dynamic GI or voxel GI solution. We just tried Unigine for a month and the voxel GI is amazing. We were able to bake lighting for a 30k square meter store without doing a single lightmap. The bake took 6 hours and already looked better than anything we achieved in UE with the same scene. Downside of Unigine is the steep price for the engineering edition, but it&#039;s got some great tools and support.<br>Unigine was also the engine TM used before UR. <br><br>For urban planning the new TM trailer does look pretty promising but in the end, if you&#039;re doing cinematics, offline rendering is still the best choice for visual quality.",

I&#039;m here to help you out. <br><br><br>Rule # 1: Don&#039;t start with character modeling as you will not have anything to show for possibly years. Be smart and do only environments, objects and stuff. NO CHARACTER MODELING OR YOU WILL QUIT BEFORE YOU EVEN START. Do it a year or two from now. <br><br>Learn Houdini for some sick modeling and it doesn&#039;t have to be procedural yo, it just has more options. Like the simple bevel tool can make entire exterior structures for you. You don&#039;t need to even touch the particle stuff and you focus only on the modeling aspect of it. It&#039;s not hard at all, you need to master maybe 15-20 buttons and you can be a god mode 3d modeler and have full control and even change stuff as you like. The nodes will give you power. <br><br>DONT BELIEVE ME? WATCH THIS VIDEO<br><br>https://vimeo.com/142470680<br><br>Learn Zbrush to model those hard finer details. Seriously use the zmodeler to rough out the shape and turn on mirroring on x,y or z and just make random details.They look nice even if they are shit. In Zbrush you must make your own UI, watch the videos and learn to redo the UI and use only whats necessary. <br><br>Learn substance Painter . Also download substance designer and watch a few tutorials and honestly you are good togo, there isn&#039;t that much to learn. <br><br>Learn those 3 and thats it. With those you can do any modeling(even characters down the line since you will know how to use zbrush already). No need to learn bullshit UV Mapping or retopology since you have substance designer for procedural textures. <br><br>3D is fun but only if you do it right. <br><br>Use old art painting for inspirations on what to model, look at the backgrounds and objects not just the nude bodies. <br><br>Pirate the software, or use trials and make new emails, download trial again, rinse and repeat. <br><br>Within 3-4 months, you can make DECENT stuff and have a portfolio .",

Anyways...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ghost Light &gt;&gt;&gt; Spotlights</span><br>The most popular lighting suggestion in DAZ tuts are the 3-point spotlights. For the first 5 months or so, I&#039;ve used that but it became annoying to set it up and &quot;perfect&quot; it till I stumbled upon the Ghost Light Kit and never looked back. It acts similarly to a Light Box or Umbrella that just generally diffuses light all around makes it softer rather than the harsh one by spotlights. The other good thing about it is it works on the Sun-Sky only mode that disables scene lights. The kit also has presets for colors and luminance.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ecvh0&#039;s Cinematic Render Resource Kit</span><br>Oh God, I wish I knew this when I started out instead of cranking up the luminance. It basically is a compilation of Tone Mapping (Exposure, Film ISO) presets for Iray. Want to lighten up the scene or darken it without touching your lights? This is it. It also comes with color profiles. I&#039;m a moron on this stuff, okay? This makes it easier.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adjust Camera Focal Length to &gt;90</span><br>The default Focal Length is 65. I started reading into photography and one of the core things it mentioned was focal length. The higher it is, the flatter the face becomes. 90 - 120 is my personal &quot;standard&quot; but you can go higher than that. One warning though, if you morphed on low focal and adjust it, your &quot;perfect&quot; morphs become mongoloid-esque after.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Skin GODDAMN Shaders</span><br>This was a game changer. I use two depending on my needs, Anagenessis 2 and Iray Ultimate Skin Manager. The former is a one-click solution whereas the latter goes full control on the skin. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scene Optimizer</span><br>We all know the drill. 4K textures on jewelry doesn&#039;t do exactly wonders on our GFX ram. Use this to cut usage in half. If you&#039;re still struggling with ram use, render the foreground and background separately. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Post-Process</span><br>PS and Lightroom.",

Lightroom is another game changer. &quot;Download&quot; the VCSO filter packs out there and use it on your renders to turn it up a notch. Though it isn&#039;t the &quot;Be-all and end-all&quot; solution &#039;cause some of them will overexpose your shit so you need to adjust in Photoshop first THEN Lightroom. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Exposed and lighter scene = Faster Render</span><br>If you want a night scene or an area to be darker DO IT IN POST PROCESS. The darker the scene, the slower Iray would render it and the more grain artifacts show up. You want the scene to be equally light and exposed but underexpose the area you want to be much darker, adjust that in gamma in Photoshop.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Render 2x the resolution of your expected output.</span><br>My files are generally 1920x1080 but I render in 2560x1440, not really 2x but the downscaling will be enough to rid most of the grains.<br><br>Pretty much that&#039;s it for me unless I&#039;m forgetting something.

Outside of render settings, these are the basics of photography, which usually leads into how similar rendering and photography can be (in terms of technique), meaning you can bring the same principles into either one. ISO and shutter speeds become very important when you&#039;re doing shots in extreme lighting. Cranking focal length to beyond 105mm gives you that isolated i.e. portrait look. <br>My addition would be making proper use of depth of field in your renders. Things like using large apertures, exaggerated bokeh, anamorphic ratios. Those can really help to elevate your renders if you&#039;re doing anything with backgrounds. <br>A comment would be for post processing. Personally, I haven&#039;t played with Iray (or Daz for that matter), but if it does have the option export your files in 16-bit (or higher). They&#039;ll be larger files but that&#039;s because 16-bit images contain more color data. That color data can be very helpful in rigorous post processing to avoid clipping. Look into colour correction and management if you want to take it to the next level (stuff like the teal and orange to create an action movie look, etc.) <br>Additionally, while the &quot;making it darker in post&quot; process is a smart trick, you have to be very careful with how you approach that. Do it badly and it&#039;s painfully obvious, since a darker scene doesn&#039;t just mean less bright lights, but also softer lights.",

Because those will cost a bit and are significantly better than things offered from Adobe and just a bit better than Reallusion (IMO, but you can also use a reallusion bridge to import daz content. This will also cost more since you&#039;d be buying DAZ content and Reallusion stuff. But may be worth it for their realtime PBR renderer.)<br><br>3.) Similar to above, depends on what you need it for. Base model meshes and generic skin are free.",

This whole argument about &quot;big studio uses [this] and not [that] so [that] must suck&quot; is kinda null since said big studio&#039;s pretty much running all customized stuff.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It can&#039;t fit into a feature pipeline.</span><br>This is neither in defense of nor against it, just more of an observation: the thing about Blender is that it&#039;s a contained system. <br>You can just tell it&#039;s meant to be an all-in-one solution (that doesn&#039;t really work out well). It tries to accomplish every single step of a typical 3D workflow, having tools for modelling, sculpting, retopologising, UV unwrapping, texturing, rigging, simulating, animating, compositing, and even video editing. It&#039;s definitely not built to cooperate with any other software. <br>But, of course, since it can&#039;t surpass the competition in any of those fields, its main attraction point is just it being free. Compared to the over-thousands you&#039;d blow on legit licenses of Maya, ZBrush, Octane, Substance Designer/Painter, Houdini, etc., it becomes a really compelling choice, since at the end of the day you get to accomplish _essentially_ what all those expensive applications were built to do for the cost of nothing. (the key word there being essentially, as to quality/standard of product, that&#039;s definitely a different story)",

If you suck at Maya or 3dsmax, it&#039;s usually not the application&#039;s fault. Same with Blender. I&#039;ve seen lots and lots of mediocre stuff because - surprise - free software lowers the entry barrier and gets you more people that don&#039;t know the first thing about 3D.

It may be useless for the express purpose of driving excessive speeds, but it still gets you from A to B.<br>Your triangles don&#039;t magically become better just because Maya blessed them. Sure, Blender can be improved in many areas, but so can Maya and 3dsmax. Difference is Blender devs don&#039;t have massive amounts of money but still improve the software, while Autodesk has almost infinite resources and still chooses to produce slow, buggy software with a UI from the last century.

It can sculpt, but Zbrush does it better. It can animate, but Maya does it better. It can simulate, but Houdini does it better. It can render, but [every &quot;industry standard&quot; renderer] does it better. The list goes on and on. Its only real strength it has over other 3DCG software is its poly-modelling suite (and that&#039;s debatable at best), and its only real strength in the real world is that it&#039;s completely free as compared to the maybe thousands you&#039;d spend on legitimate software like those cited above.",

Some are able to do everything in Blender and produce genuinely impressive results, while others just incorporate it in their workflows.

Perfect for a hardsurface brainlet like me. <br>I have qualms about the tutorial experience itself though, followed their Space VFX course a while back and while I did learn from it, what they presented was very lacking. Aidy&#039;s side was fine, albeit his entire side of the course was at a lower quality for some reason (all 720p videos compared to Gleb&#039;s 1080p). And overall the course demonstrated a surprisingly low amount of theory. It was all &quot;do it because it looks cool xddd&quot; and nothing really accurate to actual planets and all. Well, they are artists after all and that&#039;s just me being nitpicky, but I was very disappointed with how little they knew about space itself given they were doing a space-related course.<br>Then there&#039;s the usual complaints. Gleb&#039;s accent that while I did get used to, the amount of jokes he would make were a bit too excessive, and they were all hit-and-miss for the most part. <br>Guess I&#039;ll end up getting it off CGPeers or something.",

It&#039;s either 0 or 1. (due to it being an emulation you can go halfway, but then it doesn&#039;t become &quot;realistic&quot; anymore).<br>Roughness is more traditional, it&#039;s like the roughness slider on your diffuse &amp; glossy shaders. 0 - 0.500 is like 0 - 1 on a glossy roughness, and the 0.501 - 1.000 is your diffuse roughness. <br>Now, as for translating between PBR and old methods, you have to first determine if it&#039;s a metal or not. If it is, metallic all the way to 1. If it&#039;s a plastic/organic material, keep it at 0.<br>Typically your gloss map goes directly into your roughness input, but since the roughness input spans a larger range now, you&#039;ll have to tweak some stuff like I said in my earlier post. <br>Spec maps just go into the specular input as per usual, but I find specular to not do much in principled.

Once that’s done whatever will render the freestyle lines will work(such as shift+z or F12), and those lines should become a single layer in the gpencil.<br><br>So you’ll have a single gpencil layer across multiple frames. You aren’t animating the lines, but the freestyle lines are becoming gpencil lines on multiple frames meaning you can effectively edit what would have been your freestyle line around the model. Another nice perk about this is you can change the line color to, say, red and the linework on all the frames will change to that color.",

You’re going to want to disable that and pose and time the action yourself for every frame.

Also, you need good people skills since you need to communicate with the actors and clients on the set. <br>For the rnd/pipeline side, you need to know what to do with the scans and how to prepare them for whatever process they are used for later on. You need to keep researching new technologies/cameras that could be used for new versions of the scanners whatnot. If you want to go an extra mile, start learning computer vision, machine learning or programming for use with industrial machine vision cameras.<br><br>I would like it more if it was more creative.

Also the wood&#039;s basecolor seems pretty flat as well. My biggest issue is the text. It seems like its too perfect and is just sitting on top of the wood instead of being painted on. Especially for how roughed up the rest of the crate is. Maybe a bit more dirt or grime where the side 2x4s meet the flat planks would help ground it too, the corners seem to clean and that IRL is where it would accumulate.

You imply really heavily that men will just go &quot;haha hell yeah bro sweet tits&quot;, while women will call you the devil and want you removed. It&#039;s just not like that. Men can express disgust, especially in a professional environment, and women may be accepting of or even enjoy such risque content too. There&#039;s that one incident a while back about some blue-white super-busty anime chick that SJWs were going wild on, calling it &quot;oversexualisation by men once again&quot;.

Women don&#039;t feel that the female body is icky. The reason why, exactly, should be obvious. Talk to a woman one of those days, you&#039;ll quickly understand the gig.<br><br>Women are far more accepting of erotic pictures, because they are far more objective about it, on average. The entire section of your brain that goes crazy while watching a half-naked model don&#039;t exist inside a female brain. When you are stammering and trying to rationalize, women just say: &quot;yep, it&#039;s erotic, good job&quot;. They can appreciate it on a purely technical level and won&#039;t be triggered by it, not like you are biologically.<br><br>Add to that that women have developed, by nature, a strong exhibitionist instinct, and they like to self-insert into capable hypersexual characters just as men like to self-insert into capable hypersexual characters, and you&#039;ll be surprised how level-headed, accepting, and even appreciating they can be of risqué art. I&#039;ve found that men on average are far more easily triggered by 3d titties.<br><br>It is globally the same thing with prostitution. Talk to an average woman about her views on prostitution one of those days. The discussion is always enlightening. Men are a bundle of repressed and contradictory instincts when they think of prostitution. Most women see it as a perfectly normal job, or even one that is glamorous (when done in a classy way, escorts gaining mad cash and everything).",

          "com": "Hi, guys, I recently started to design some furniture, where i have to incorporate some acanthus leaf designs.<br><br>The problem is, that i have no clue on how I should go about this. Normally I use Autocad for furniture design and Zbrush for more organic stuff. But the problem I am running into is, that I have no idea, how to make a one of those retarded scroll patterns in Zbrush. There are basically 2 options:<br><br>A) Use Zmodeler: Most scroll designs are pretty complex, so it is going to be an ass load of work doing all the detail work in zmodeler.<br><br>B)Using Brushes: Also going to be pretty hard, due to lots of semi hard surfaces and geometry that is derived from specific chisel shapes, that has to stay consistent throughout everything, flowing into each other.<br><br>So my idea was to block out the basic shapes, by using either masking and extruding or zmodeler and then working in the details with normal brushes. I have made it past the first step ezpz, but I can&#039;t seem to work in stuff, like the outer and inner curves on the leaves, since they are such a shitty mix of organic and hard surfaces.<br><br>I am not that bad at Zbrush (can make basic stuff like assets for video games and animals), but I have been trying for two days now and i can never get this shit to look right. On top of all that, my file got corrupted when Zbrush crased today and now I am srsly thinking about just throwing my tablet out the window.<br><br>So, what brushes would you guys use to make pic related?",

Now try with the leg: sculpt it from reference, practice it again by sculpting the next day, and finally sculpt it again on the next day. After this, put your first and second sculpts of the arm and the leg side by side, and compare between them: did drawing help you learn better sculpting with the arm as opposed to what just practicing by sculpting did for the leg?

That&#039;s called being a consumer.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can I develop interest into making art?</span><br>Highly subjective. You can try to nurture passion and interest, but there&#039;s close to zero guarantee of it blossoming.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How much resistence do you have between you and finishing an art piece?</span><br>Procrastination, external distractions (life, schooling, work, family, etc.), lack of technical skill.

Even day by day. Some days I can spend hours fooling around in whatever software I want to, some days I don&#039;t even feel like turning on my computer.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How you adjust your lifestyle to work best with making art?</span><br>Like the developing interest question, this is an equally subjective matter. The best I can really say is &quot;experiment until you find what works best&quot;. Some people are able to work countless hours per day, while others burn out too quickly attempting the same.<br><br>I can tell you&#039;re just overthinking things too much. If you&#039;re looking into beginning 3D, just remember this: it doesn&#039;t have to be your life. Many people do it as a hobby. And about your whole &quot;I don&#039;t do it!&quot; thing, it&#039;s the same as learning another language, playing an instrument, hell, even asking the girl you like for a date.

Something simple like a opened grand piano, strings visible and all, to be used in a render, so no retopology/LOD necessary for import into games, nor animation of the piano keys or something like that. You have a reference sheet on hand, so it&#039;s just tracing and then doing touch-ups. The entire process is just modelling, texturing, material set-up, render. How long would that take for someone experienced to accomplish? A week? Several days? Maybe even just a single day?<br>2) The full bells-and-whistles of character modelling. Let&#039;s say it&#039;s fully sculpted in A/T-pose, textured, rigged then posed, clothed using something simpler like MD, propped with other nonsense like bags or armour, then finally rendered. It&#039;s not &quot;stylised&quot;/cartoon-y either, rather maybe like a Daz-tier model. How long would _that_ take? A month or more, maybe even less?<br><br>Both scenarios assume that the artist is working alone, but has plenty of experience and has done all of that before.",

Especially seeing as I&#039;m just learning and not 100% sure I want to adopt it into my regular workflow.<br><br>...Is running a cracked copy of Modo just totally out of the question?

Maybe it has more to do with the way modeling is taught at first, that is, building small pieces as a whole, even if they are composed of distinct parts (like the lid of a jar, for example). So, when the time comes a beginner intends to make something more complex, that habit carries on and they are faced with the daunting task of building a closed mesh for it -- that&#039;s when they wonder if it would be okay to do something they have never done before, but that would be much easier -- making the object out of intersecting, simpler pieces.<br><br>tl;dr: In my opinion, it&#039;s just a matter of habit due to having practiced modeling on simple pieces that can be easily done in a single mesh.",

(It&#039;s buried in a entirely separate set of menus for textures that you have to activate per shader individually through a mass of drop down menus, and any time you want to move it you have to jump between animation/the main tab and texturing to move it by amount of percent&#039;s across instead of being able to rig it to something sensible.)<br>Blender (with a competent UI) would be by leaps and bounds a improvement, and I&#039;ve animated a entire short with the thing, along with large chunks of other projects that either were abandoned halfway through or I&#039;m still on now.",

You can go old and stable (say, stay with Maya 2015 or Houdini 16.0), or fancy new but possibly unstable (Maya 2018 or Houdini 16.5). But even here &quot;unstable&quot; is quite an overstatement -- these releases undergo loads of quality assessment before release, and (usually) only &quot;niche&quot; fixes are needed afterwards. Which is why you normally want to be able (and will need) to download new versions. This just goes with the territory, the more complex a piece of software is, the more moving parts it has and the bigger is the probability of it failing in some scenarios.<br><br>In my opinion, you are demanding a level of software quality that simply isn&#039;t found outside of NASA and similar venues, and thus setting you up for inevitable frustration. You won&#039;t be able to find what you are looking for.",

I doubt someone has the model, created simple renders, then uploaded them to the wiki. <br>As regards the model itself, it&#039;s not that difficult a piece to make in terms of the skillset required (it&#039;s pretty simple box modeling with bevel modifiers and smoothing) but there&#039;s quite a lot of &quot;detail&quot; (although I would call it kitbashed greebling and garbage) that would take a while to model. <br><br>As for how people rip models from games: Most models are ripped via NinjaRipper software that rips from an emulator or a PC game. NinjaRipper basically rips the information directly from your graphics card, which results in a metric assload of extra shit you have to manually cleanup, so it can potentially be a bit of an undertaking which is why it&#039;s largely done by hyper autists found on VGResources, TheModelsResource, or porn artists. <br>There are a ton of japanese 3d model repositories akin to yobi3d, t3dm (now goes by some other URL), but you need to be able to read moonrunes. I don&#039;t know any really, I&#039;ve just stumbled across text files with direct links to stuff hosted on fc2 or niconico; they&#039;re usually MMD files<br><br>If you have access to some sort of photographs or scans or whatever of the plastic kit, that would make it a lot easier to accurately model",

I&#039;m more of ps1/ps2 era ac guy myself.<br><br>Anyway, if you could link the page, that would be helpful. Here is some information that&#039;s going to true for just about any game:<br><br>Chances are, you&#039;re going to need software designed to unpack the game&#039;s files. Either someone needs to write it, or you need to write the software yourself. If the model data is compressed, chances are it just uses a standard compression algorithm, so decompressing the stuff wouldn&#039;t be too hard if you can figure the compression method. <br><br>On to data about the models themselves. Almost all 3D data is stored in floating point notation (float for short). Floating point arithmetic is how most of the math on your computer is done in regards to 3D. Floating point numbers are highly precise at their origin (0) and tend to lose accuracy has their values become higher. <br><br>There are multiple types of floats, but the most common is the 32bit single-precision float. This is the data you&#039;ll want to look for, for getting the models out.<br><br>Beyond this, everything is going to require specialized knowledge of whatever model format the game uses. This, in and of itself can be hard to learn, but when you&#039;re dealing with proprietary model formats that the game likely uses, which would have very sparse public documentation, this becomes even more difficult. This is why you don&#039;t see that a lot of programs to extract models from games.<br><br>All of this data is probably located in a giant binary file on the disc (probably the largest file on it). This is really the best lead I can give you, unfortunately.<br><br>And as for the renders in the wiki page, I would have to guess these were done at FromSoftware. It&#039;s not that its impossible to extract the models from the game, but it would take a tremendous amount of patience to do the research in a hex-editor, the reverse engineering, and writing the software.",

Json+obj was designed as a neutral platform-independent release so that one could develop tools to import into any environment or experimental render engine of choice. The main issue is that modern render engines do the instancing inside the engine, but the instancing information is lost here, which makes it a clunky dataset.

Your donuts are also really tiny with respect to the phone(?) and the mug in the background, but maybe you were going to minidonuts. Their size also makes it hard to comment on them, but they look okay. The sprinkles look kinda like those larvae you find in rice though. It&#039;s still a pretty good job.

Compared to the earlier builds of 2.8, it&#039;s progressed very nicely. <br>I&#039;m quite on the fence about the UI changes though. On one hand, it looks incredible. I love how much cleaner it looks. The sorting of the properties panel is done excellently, and from the themes panel it&#039;s even more complex than before. <br>On the other hand, they&#039;ve changed/outright removed some UI features that I wish were explained (well maybe they are in the docs, but eh). Took me a while to realise Layers are now Collections, and it was quite the annoying ten minutes trying to switch layers and only realising you had to tick the little # symbol in the outliner (side note: why though? the eye under toggle visibility worked perfectly in the past, don&#039;t see a reason to split it up into viewport visibility and actual objects being there). <br>Due to me being a pretty big macro nerd, it also pissed me off to find out they&#039;d changed some of the shortcuts that I use and abuse all the time. On such a shortcut-reliant program, I really don&#039;t think it was wise to reengineer them &quot;even if it&#039;s for the sake of beginners&quot;. [Shift+S] to Save Image, really? What was the problem with good ol&#039; F3? And what happened to accessing fly mode with [Shift+F]? I still haven&#039;t been able to figure out how. And for some reason, occasional right-clicking brings up some context menu that I just don&#039;t see the point of. I just want to select my objects, dammit.<br>Going into nitpicking territories, the increased border width of selected objects sure is thick. I do like that the borders remain active during Render Preview, however they&#039;re just so thick they easily occlude finer details like reflections. But I&#039;d expect it to be easily changed in the Theme settings. Hopefully. <br>/rant",

The new &quot;quick&quot; menu should be useful for any operators which are either buried or non-existent in the UI like &quot;grid fill&quot;, &quot;select boundary loop&quot;, &quot;subdivide edge ring&quot; etc.<br>I&#039;m really happy that you can finally enable snapping to increments and geometry at the same time and, although it&#039;s been in the 2.79 nightlies for while, the bevel node is very helpful for adding wear and tear.<br>Maybe someone will find multi-object editing useful too I guess.",

This early on, it at least looks like a face. You can always open it up in sculpt mode and pull/magnify/shrink certain features to make them look better - if you separate ( the face, and add the multiresolution modifier, you can increase the level of detail on the face to give yourself more vertices to work with (think of it as the subdivision modifier but more malleable)<br><br>The last part, I literally just mean getting your reference image (<a href=\"#p632732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;632732</a>) and opening it up in a graphics program (gimp, paint, photoshop) and then outlining the biggest, basic shapes with a pen, cropping a copy of the head unit and setting it up from the head to the feet to see how tall your model will need to be. think of it as reducing the character to its basic blocks<br><br>If you haven&#039;t already, you should be using your reference image as a background image (only works in orthographic mode) in Blender, set to appear on your Y and X axis, and scaling it to fit your model/vice versa.<br><br>I don&#039;t think you&#039;ve got off to a bad start, really.

So keep in mind that while you will be able to make pretty figures, there&#039;s no way in he&#039;ll you are painting on them unless you find a way to retopolgize them, and that is a topic on its own.

The truth is, like me, you have to learn a bunch of stuff - now, I know - that is precisely the answer you don&#039;t want. And it sounds fucking daunting. &#039;How the fuck am I supposed to learn 5 major 3D packages when just Maya is frying my brain?&#039;<br><br>I know. I&#039;ve been there. But I slogged through it, got over the hump, and the truth is: once you&#039;ve learned the core concepts of one of the major hub-applications (Maya or Max) everything else kinda falls into place and it&#039;s no big deal. You&#039;ll pick up another suite and find your way round in a day or two and that&#039;ll be it - boom, you&#039;re now a Modo guy, or a Fusion360 guy or whatever. The big dirty secret to this whole game is that anyone only ever needs to know about 10-20 features of any given application to do anything. <br><br>Anyway - more specific answers. And before you ask, yes I use all this shit and I&#039;m pretty good with most of it so...<br><br>1. I &#039;learned&#039; on Maya, and it almost made me quit. I hated it. It is SO unfriendly and buggy and just not suited to heavy modelling projects. I know this because I switched to Max, and have never looked back. For literally any modeller - Max is the better hub application. I could give a list of reasons why but it&#039;d take too long. Ditch Maya, learn Max.<br>2. Fusion360 is not what you&#039;d call a core application. Like Zbrush, it&#039;s one of the things you use for a specific task in conjunction with your hub application(s) - Max / Maya / Modo. Fusion is not an alternative to those tools.<br>3. If you&#039;re gonna start incorporating things like Fusion into your workflow, you will also need to know Zbrush. Forget about sculpting etc. for the moment - Zbrush is an essential tool for bringing together all of your hi-poly stuff that you&#039;ve made in various things and allowing you to finalise it all and get it polished up, ready to be a bake source. It sorts out so much shit for you. Again - Zbrush isn&#039;t really optional. <br><br>So tl:dr - learn Max, then everything else.",

Traditional modeling methods typically have you juggle having to create a required shape while ensuring the topology is good, while if you just sculpt the object out with no regard for topology, you can get the needed result faster, and worry about the low-poly later.<br><br>Even if you&#039;ll be using one of these tools, you&#039;ll want some sort of traditional 3D editor for building the low-poly meshes, which can be something like Max, and of course it&#039;s pretty good on its own even without them. Modo is used largely for mesh fusion, which is a really fancy boolean tool that lets you create various types of edge chamfers at bool intersections, but its value has gone down a bit since you can just import models from any other package into Zbrush and remesh them to get similar result.<br><br><a href=\"#p633435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;633435</a><br>That&#039;s kind of irrelevant to the question at hand, though, which is game art. Houdini can be pretty bonkers at hard surface if your goal is making ultra-complex structures out of millions of pieces of geometry that would be impossible to place by hand, but making an optimized variant would still require you to build something more optimized by hand.

And as I said previously, it&#039;d take too long to give you a full answer. <br><br>But... as a point of comparison, watch a Maya modelling tutorial and see how many times the tutor says something like the following:<br>&#039;...and at this point you should delete your history...&#039; <br>&#039;...always remember before going too far into your project - delete your history regularly&#039;<br>&#039;...if you notice something strange happen here - delete your history and try again...&#039;<br><br>You will hear Maya users say that a *lot*. The construction history is Maya&#039;s attempt at a linear non-destructive workflow, like the modifier stack - but it SUCKS. No-one really uses it and it ends up just being a liability - it&#039;s just a bunch of corruptions waiting to happen.
